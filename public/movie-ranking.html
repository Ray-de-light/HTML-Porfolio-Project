<p>(US) I've watched this so many times and still love it!</p>
<h3>Wild Tales</h3>
<p>(Argentina) a collection of 6 short stories about getting revenge when life's frustrations reach absurd levels.</p>
<h3>Groundhog Day</h3>
<p>(US) An excellent film based on the perineal idea: What if I could live my life over again.</p>
